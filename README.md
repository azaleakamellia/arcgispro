#### Introduction :loudspeaker:
This repository compiles all the interesting stuff I found while scouring around the Internet that can be developed and reproduced for personal self-study research. Some of them will lead to small projects and snippets of codes which will majorly revolve around earth observation image analysis; partcularly Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2.<br>

In a nutshell, this is a personal notebook/portfolio. Everything finalized and published here are compilation of references and and how-tos from various sources that are disclosd in each Jupyter Notebook. Each has been tested on my own and any further details on the how-to (should there be any) can be accessed at my [blog](https://azaleakamellia.tumblr.com). Any information regarding the sources are cited/linked. If you are the owner of the content referred in the notes/exercises and have any issues with it, please contact me immediately so that I can remove them from my notes.


#### Contact :mailbox:
Don't be a stranger and feel free to reach out to me at [@azaleakamellia](https://twitter.com/azaleakamellia) if you have any questions or recommendations of tutorials, spatial data analysis or cartographical output you'd think I could try out.

#### Current work :pushpin:
