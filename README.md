# spatially :earth_asia:

#### Introduction :loudspeaker:
This repository compiles all the interesting stuff I found while scouring around the Internet that can be developed and reproduced for personal self-study research. Some of them will lead to small projects and snippets of codes which will revolve around spatial data analysis and cartographical projects in the interactive platform using **Python spatial** data modules. It may also include some exploration of the **ArcGIS API for JavaScript** and **ArcGIS Python for API** codes.<br>

In a nutshell, this is a personal notebook/portfolio. Everything finalized and published here were tested on my own and the details on the how-to can be accessed at my [blog](https://azaleakamellia.tumblr.com).


#### Contact :mailbox:
Don't be a stranger and feel free to reach out to me at [@azaleakamellia](https://twitter.com/azaleakamellia) if you have any questions or recommendations of tutorials, spatial data analysis or cartographical output you'd think I could try out.

#### Upcoming project :pushpin:
1. Exploratory analysis and visualization of spatial data (ESDA)
